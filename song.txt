Forever in my mind, only you (I want you to live, I want that more than anything in this world)
The pieces in my life go away with you (I want you to fight like hell to stay with us)
Forever in my mind, only you (But with everybody else gone, I know, it might not be what you want, It might be too hard for you to keep fighting, so)
The pieces in my life run away with you (If you wanna go, I want you to know it's okay)
Forever in my mind
I was all alone, on my own, it's okay though
Do you really love me, do you really trust me?
I was down bad, feelin' sad, feelin' sorry
Now you really gone, and I can't get you to call me
